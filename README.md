Do not lay there wallowing in your past ! 
Your past is back there.
What love do through forgiveness than sit up in here and win damn argument.
Right !
Pursing your passion !
"Rise Again"

When shadows fall and hope seems far,
And dreams lie broken where they are,
Don’t let the silence steal your flame—
Stand tall, and rise beyond the pain.

The road is rough, the hills are steep,
The nights are long, the wounds run deep.
But every scar tells where you've been—
A map of strength that lies within.

Each failure is a stepping stone,
A voice that says, “You're not alone.”
For storms will pass, and skies will clear,
And every fall brings triumph near.

So lift your eyes and take the fight,
Hold tight your heart, pursue the light.
Success is born from trials faced—
A crown that's earned, not merely placed.
